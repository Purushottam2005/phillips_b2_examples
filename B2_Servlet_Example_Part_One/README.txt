Building Block (B2) Example Part One

This Building Block project demonstrates a very simple application that can be
deployed to a Blackboard Learn 9.1 application server.
This B2 is a course tool and will display on the Course Tools menu
for any course in Blackboard.
See the bb-manifest.xml file for the Building Block's settings.
When you click on this B2 in Blackboard the index.jsp
will be rendered.
